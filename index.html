                <p class="text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and local.[7] Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in India is 10:3</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag">The education system in India is a diverse and structured framework designed to cater to a vast and varied population. It comprises multiple levels, including pre-primary, primary, secondary, and higher education, governed by central and state authorities like CBSE, ICSE, and state boards. Government schools provide free or subsidized education, while private schools offer advanced facilities and varied curricula. Higher education institutions, including IITs, IIMs, and AIIMS, are globally recognized for excellence. The system promotes multilingualism, with Hindi, English, and regional languages as mediums of instruction. Despite advancements in access and literacy, challenges such as quality disparities, rote learning, and rural-urban divides persist. The National Education Policy 2020 aims to address these by emphasizing skill development, digital integration, and equitable access. With continued reforms and investments, India’s education system strives to foster innovation, inclusivity, and global competitiveness for a brighter future.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag">Education History In India</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag">The history of education in India is deeply rooted in its ancient culture and traditions. In ancient times, education was imparted through Gurukuls, where students lived with their teachers (gurus) and learned various subjects like Vedas, philosophy, mathematics, medicine, astronomy, and arts. Institutions like Takshashila and Nalanda were renowned centers of learning, attracting students from across the world. With the advent of Islamic rule, Madrasas emerged as educational hubs, focusing on religious studies, literature, and science. The British colonial era marked a significant shift, introducing a Western-style education system emphasizing English as the medium of instruction and creating institutions like universities in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras. While this system promoted modern disciplines like science and law, it sidelined traditional knowledge systems. Post-independence, India prioritized universal education and literacy, leading to initiatives like the Right to Education (RTE) Act and mid-day meal schemes to ensure accessibility. The establishment of premier institutions like IITs, IIMs, and AIIMS marked milestones in higher education. Over the years, India’s education system has evolved with a focus on technology, research, and inclusivity, guided by reforms like the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. This rich history reflects India's journey toward a balanced blend of traditional wisdom and modern knowledge.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag">Education Stages In India</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag">The education system in India is structured into several stages designed to cater to the diverse needs of learners. It begins with pre-primary education, including nursery and kindergarten (LKG, UKG), focusing on foundational skills for children aged 3–6 years. The primary stage, covering grades 1 to 5, emphasizes basic literacy, numeracy, and early exposure to science and social studies. The upper primary or middle stage, encompassing grades 6 to 8, introduces a broader curriculum with subjects like mathematics, science, history, and languages, fostering critical thinking. Secondary education, comprising grades 9 and 10, deepens subject knowledge and culminates in board examinations that assess students' readiness for higher education. Senior secondary education, covering grades 11 and 12, allows students to specialize in streams like science, commerce, or arts, preparing them for college and professional courses. Higher education includes undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral studies offered by universities, colleges, and specialized institutions. Vocational training and skill-based programs are also integrated to enhance employability. India’s education system accommodates diverse curricula, including CBSE, ICSE, and state boards, ensuring inclusivity. Recent reforms like the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 aim to make education more holistic, multidisciplinary, and accessible, preparing students for a dynamic global environment.</p>
